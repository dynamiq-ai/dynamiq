        No default implementation — each writing backend defines its OWN write path (Neo4j and Neptune
        build ``MERGE`` statements and run them; the relational Postgres store writes its own tables).
        Backends that do not support writing (e.g. AGE, ``_writes_graph = False``) inherit this and raise.

        Implementations accept these payloads and return a stats dict (``nodes_created``,
        ``relationships_created``, ``properties_set``, ``records``, ``keys``). The explicit id/name and
        endpoint-name/description fields below are stored as ordinary node/edge properties (folded into the
        persisted property bag), so the on-disk shape stays flat; only the payload is structured.
            Nodes — ``labels: list[str]``, ``id: str`` (the merge key), optional ``name: str``, optional
                ``properties: dict`` (any remaining attributes). Written ``MERGE (n {id}) ON CREATE SET``.
            Relationships — ``type``, ``start_node``/``end_node`` (each an endpoint ref: ``label`` is the
                endpoint type, ``id`` the endpoint to match, ``name`` its display name), optional
                ``description``, optional ``properties`` (provenance/ACL/metadata) and ``identity_keys``
                (property keys folded into the MERGE pattern so edges differing only on those stay
                distinct). The endpoint ``name``s and ``description`` are folded into the persisted edge
                property bag as flat ``src_name``/``dst_name``/``description``. Written ``MERGE ... SET``.

        The explicit, caller-driven counterpart to ``write_graph`` — analogous to
        :meth:`BaseVectorStore.delete_documents_by_file_ids` on the vector side: writing never deletes
        on its own, so to replace a document's facts the caller deletes them here, then re-writes.

        Deletes every relationship stamped with one of these ``source_doc_id`` values, and the
        document-scoped nodes whose label is in ``doc_scoped_labels`` (e.g. ``AttributeValue`` — value
        nodes that belong to exactly one document).

        Identity nodes (entities) are SHARED across documents, so they are kept as long as another
        document still cites them. When ``orphan_labels`` is given (e.g. ``Entity``), a node with one of
        those labels is deleted once removing this document's edges leaves it with NO remaining
        relationship — i.e. this was its last citing document. Because provenance lives on the edges, this
        is derived from edge degree, not from any per-node bookkeeping. When ``orphan_labels`` is omitted,
        entities are never deleted here and a later ``write_graph`` re-MERGEs them unchanged. The caller
        passes the labels so this layer stays neutral of KG semantics. Returns
        ``{"nodes_deleted", "relationships_deleted"}``.
