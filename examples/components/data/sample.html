<h2>1. Pull Up Account</h2>
<p>First, you will need to locate the customer's account. This can be done by asking for the <strong>Full Name</strong> or <strong>Account ID</strong>.</p>
<p><code>[Pull up Account]</code></p>
<h2>2. Verify Identity</h2>
<p>Next, verify the customer's identity to access their orders. This requires gathering information you may have collected in the first step.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Account ID</strong></li>
<li><strong>Order ID</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><code>[Verify Identity]</code></p>
<h2>3. Check Shipping Status</h2>
<p>Understanding the shipping status of the item is crucial. Ask the customer for this information or look it up in the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Statuses to look for: <code>Order Received</code>, <code>In Transit</code>, <code>Out for Delivery</code>, <code>Delivered</code></li>
<li>If the status is <code>Order Received</code>, proceed to directly update the order.</li>
<li>For <code>In Transit</code>, <code>Out for Delivery</code>, or <code>Delivered</code>, it's too late to add items.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>[Shipping Status]</code></p>
<h2>4. Membership Privileges</h2>
<p>Silver and Gold members are entitled to certain perks. Determine the customer's membership level.</p>
<ul>
<li>If they are a <strong>Gold</strong> or <strong>Silver</strong> member and the item has already shipped, prepare to ship the new item in a separate order with no additional shipping fee.</li>
<li>Utilize the <code>[Membership Privileges]</code> option in the system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Make the Purchase</h2>
<p>To add an item, you'll need specific details about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the product's details</li>

<h2>6. Canned Responses</h2>
<p>Here are some useful phrases for dialogue:</p>
<p><strong>If adding an item:</strong>
"Great news! I've successfully added [Item Name] to your order. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?"</p>
<p><strong>If unable to add an item due to shipping status:</strong>
"I'm sorry, but your current order is already [In Transit/Out for Delivery/Delivered], and I can't add an item to it at this stage. However, I can place a new order for you with [Item Name], and ensure it's sent out ASAP."</p>
<p><strong>Membership acknowledgment:</strong>
"As a valued [Silver/Gold] member, we'll ship your new item without any additional shipping costs."</p>
<h2>7. Marking Conversations</h2>
<p>Upon completion of the interaction, remember to mark the conversation accordingly in the customer support survey.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete and Successful</strong> - When the customer's request has been fully met.</li>
<li><strong>Complete but Not Successful</strong> - If the item couldn't be added to the order, ensuring to apologize for any inconvenience caused.</li>
</ul>
