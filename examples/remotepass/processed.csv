Learn how to streamline your contract management by using custom fields.

Custom Fields allow you to enhance workers' contract info by including specific details like _cost centers or team information_. Additionally, you can collect data from workers when they submit their _work or timesheets_ for approval. This information can then be easily exported with your reports for a seamless data management experience.

**How to Create a Custom Field?**  
To add a custom field, follow these steps:  
1. Navigate to **Company Settings**.  
2. Locate and select the **Custom Fields** tab.  
3. Click on **Add new**, provide the details for the new field, and select where you want the custom field to apply: either to **Contract Details** or to the **Timesheet/Work Submission** form.

**Application Areas**  
### **Contract Details Area:**  
* The custom field is _visible to the company but hidden from the worker_.  
* It's incorporated into the Contract Creation flow, and you can modify its value at any time via the contract settings tab.  

### **Timesheet/Work Submission:**  
* The field is accessible to _both the company and the worker_.  
* For _Pay As You Go or Milestone contracts_, workers will be prompted to provide information in this field upon submitting their work.  

### **Reports:**

**Is it possible to modify the value of custom fields?**  
* For Contract Details: Yes, changes can be made anytime via the contract's settings page.  
* For Timesheet/Work Submission: Yes, but only if the submission has not yet been approved."
http://help.remotepass.com/en/articles/9573740-default-time-off-time-off-policies,Default Time Off & Time Off Policies?,"**Default Time Off & Time Off Policies?**

When you create a new contract, the **Default Time Off policy** settings are applied. You can track _time off, review (approve/decline) requests, and decide if the time off is Paid or Unpaid._ Note that the Default Time Off policy operates on a **non-accrual** basis.

**How do Time Off policies work?**

Time off policies allow you to define different types of leave, including PTO, sick leave, bereavement leave, religious leave, and others, while also keeping track of each employee's time off usage. There are two types of Time off Policies:

### **Accrual Time Off Policy**
Accrual time off policies allow you to _track, review, and **accrue time off balances** over_ _time_, which is great for managing **_annual leave or paid time off_**. You can set parameters for when accruals begin, their frequency, carry-over rules, and establish guidelines for requests, including minimum and maximum time off periods, half-day requests, and waiting periods for new employees.

### **Non-Accrual Time Off Policy**
Non-accrual policies allow you to _track and review leaves simply_, which is great for managing leaves that do not require accrual, such as **_sick, parental, or bereavement leaves._**

**How to create a Custom Time Off Policy?**

To create a Time Off Policy **with Accruals**, follow these steps:

To create a Time Off Policy **without Accruals**, follow these steps:

**How to assign workers to a policy?**

There are two ways to assign a worker to a policy:

**Option 1: From the Policy Settings**

**Option 2: From the Worker Time Off Setting**

**Can I Revert to the Default Time Off Policy After Assigning a Worker to a Custom Policy?**
Yes, you have full control over your policies and can revert to the previous policy anytime. 

**How to unassign a policy?**

**How to change a policy?**

**How to Add/Deduct Time from a Time Off Balance for a Worker?**

**How to View Reports on Your Team's Time Off**
The reports page provides high-level analytics on time off usage and requests by status for different groups. For more detailed reports on **time off** **usage** by status or **accrued balances** over a specific period, follow these steps:

**What Happens to Accrued Time Off When a Different Accrual Policy is Applied?**
When assigning a new accrual policy, you will be prompted to select the accrual start date. Based on your selection, a simulation of the newly accrued time off will be displayed for your review before you confirm. Any time off accrued before the selected date will remain unchanged.

The **Default Time Off** policy is assigned to all new contracts, allowing you to track and approve/decline time off requests.

**When are vacation days credited—at the start or end of the accrual cycle?**
Vacation days are credited at the _end_ of the accrual cycle, with the exception of the **Yearly** frequency. For Yearly accruals, vacation days are credited _at the start_ of the year. For example, a vacation policy offering 22 days annually will credit the full 22 days to the worker’s balance at the beginning of the calendar year. During the first year of employment, the credited balance is prorated based on the start date.

**Can I offer extra vacation days based on years of service?**
Yes, for vacation type policies, you can add tenure rules during the Policy Details configuration step. These rules allow you to grant additional annual vacation days to workers based on their length of service.

**When are vacation days carried over?**
Either on the **first** **day** of the **calendar** year (e.g., **January** **1st**) or **12** **months** **after** the earning start date (e.g., if it starts on August 12, 2024, carryover occurs on August 11, 2025). This is **configurable** per policy.

**How can I ensure carried-over days are used first?**
By default, carried-over time off is used before the newly accrued days."

Termination during the probation period
---------------------------------------
In most jurisdictions, the employer and the employee have the right to end the employment contract during the probationary period by giving a notice of termination or resignation. The required length of this notice varies according to the employment laws of the country in question.

This involves providing severance payments following local labor laws, additional payments based on local best practices (if applicable), and obtaining signed waivers to safeguard against potential legal and reputational issues for all parties involved.

http://help.remotepass.com/en/articles/7876845-what-are-additional-checks,What are additional checks?,"**What are additional checks?**

Although we make every effort to process transfers quickly, sometimes, transfers may be subjected to additional checks by intermediate or receiving banks before the funds are credited to your account. This does not necessarily indicate a problem with the transaction.

Banks are governed by global and local regulations and have their own internal compliance protocols aimed at ensuring maximum adherence to compliance standards and safeguarding against fraudulent activities and illegal practices. Unfortunately, **RemotePass has no visibility or control over such cases' processing times and specifics**.

**What do extra additional checks mean?**

Additional checks may be triggered by inconsistencies in transfer details such as name, address, etc., unusual activity, or merely as a part of routine checks. Each bank has unique internal compliance protocols/processes and reserves the right to maintain confidentiality. **Neither RemotePass nor its banking partners have access to these details**. In certain situations, the bank might require additional information, which RemotePass can provide.

**What steps should I take if my transfer is selected for additional checks?**

After the bank completes the additional checks, they decide to deposit the funds into your bank account or reject the transfer. If the transfer is rejected, the amount will be returned to your RemotePass balance, and you can then opt for a different withdrawal method or account.

**How long does it take for the additional checks to be completed?**

The duration for these checks can range from 2 to 14 business days, although it may take longer in some cases. The details of these additional checks are often confidential, and hence, **Neither RemotePass nor its banking partners** cannot provide the specifics or a time frame.

**Is it possible for RemotePass to expedite the processing time?**

RemotePass does not have the authority or insight into the internal protocols of intermediary and receiving banks. However, if additional information is required, RemotePass will immediately respond and cooperate accordingly.

**Is it possible to recall or cancel a transfer under additional checks?**

Until a final decision is reached by the bank, the transfer cannot be canceled or recalled."
http://help.remotepass.com/en/articles/7876833-how-long-does-it-take-to-receive-a-transfer,How long does it take to receive a transfer?,"**How long does a transfer take after requesting a withdrawal?**

The length of time it takes to receive a transfer varies on several factors, including the country and currency of withdrawal, as well as any security and compliance checks that may be necessary. When you request a withdrawal, the estimated time of arrival (**ETA)** for the transfer will be displayed on the confirmation page, along with the **transfer fee** and the **exact amount to be received**.

You can find the ETA on the transaction receipt under the **transactions page** >> **details**. Our payment processing is limited to business days (Monday to Friday) and is subject to the processing times of our banking partners.

To ensure the safety of your funds, our banking partners may need to verify your personal details, such as your ID, banking information, or address. This process, known as verification, is intended to protect your money and can add additional time to your transfer beyond the initial ETA.

http://help.remotepass.com/en/articles/8017140-what-is-instant-card-payout,What is Instant Card Payout?,"**What is Instant Card Payout?**

The Instant Card Payout method is a recently introduced withdrawal option that enables contractors on RemotePass to transfer funds directly to their card-connected bank account. This method allows them to receive money instantly and deposit it directly into their card/bank account without any delays.

**How to use the Instant Card Payout method?**

You can add the Instant Card Payout method from your profile settings or during withdrawal steps.

1. Navigate to your Profile Settings.
2. Click on Withdrawal methods and then Add Account.
3. Choose Instant Card Payout and add your card details.

You can also activate auto-withdraw, which means your earnings will be sent directly to the registered card as soon as you get paid. Note that the card may take a few hours to get verified before you can use it. This verification is just a one-time process. You'll receive an email notification once the card is successfully verified, and you can start using it immediately.

**What are the benefits of the Instant Card Payout method?**

- **Convenience:** Card payouts provide a convenient way to receive funds directly into your card account.
- **Speed:** Card Payout is instant compared to traditional international bank transfers. Once the payout is initiated, the funds are usually available on the card within a short period, ensuring quick access to your money.
- **Security:** Payouts to cards often incorporate robust security measures to protect users' financial information and prevent unauthorized access to funds. This adds an extra layer of security, ensuring your money remains safe during transactions and account activities.

**What cards and countries are eligible for the Instant Card Payout method?**

Currently, the Instant Card Payout method applies to Visa and Mastercard, including debit and credit cards, as long as they are linked to a bank account.

**What is the transfer fee for the Instant Card Payout method?**

The transfer fee of 2% is applied with a minimum fee of $5 and a maximum fee of $15. The minimum withdrawal amount is $15.

**How long does it take to receive money using Instant Card Payout?**

In most cases, the transaction can take a few seconds; however, in some circumstances, the transaction can take longer to reach the beneficiary because the receiving bank takes longer to apply the funds to the beneficiary’s account.

**Can I add multiple cards to the Instant Card Payout method?**

Yes, it is possible to add multiple cards to your account.

**Is the Instant Card Payout method available to all users everywhere?**

The Instant Card Payout feature is available only to contractors in certain countries. We are working closely with our provider to expand its availability to more countries and currencies.
