            "Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 - 18 April 1955) was a German-born "
            "theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of the greatest and most "
            "influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the "
            "theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum "
            "mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping "
            "of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished "
            "in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass-energy equivalence "
            "formula E = mc^2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "
            "'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in "
            "Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his "
            "discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the "
            "development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on "
            "the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists "
            "worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the "
            "greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and "
            "originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius."
